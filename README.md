# traefikmanager
This is a script to make Installing and using Traefik easy 

Please note, that this is my first attempt and my first Project. 
Its very unstable and some functions dont work as expected.
Installing Traefik and manage routes #should work fine 

usage:

be root / have sudo rights
Download into directory of your choice
then:
chmod +x traefikmanager.sh
mv traefikmanager.sh /usr/local/bin/traefikmanager


after that you only have to type "sudo traefikmanager" into your Console to use it.
Have fun testing it :)


it does not install or change ufw rules.
